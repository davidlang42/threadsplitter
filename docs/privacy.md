## Summary
All data is processed entirely on Google’s servers, within the Google Apps Scripts platform. Email data is stored in GMail directly, and only temporarily in memory within the Google Apps Script system while the threads are being split. This is private to your google account, and ThreadSplitter (and its developers) have absolutely no access to this, so your data stays private (in line with your Google Account’s data retention policy).
